2017.10.11 Version 2.0.0
 * Added support for taking a snapshot of a share.
 * IOExceptions wrapping StorageExceptions will now contain the StorageException message in the outer exception.
 * Connection string support expanded to allow AccountName to be specified with SharedAccessSignature and DefaultEndpointsProtocol.  In this case, SharedAccessSignature is used for credentials, while having both DefaultEndpointsProtocol and AccountName allows the library to infer a set of default endpoints.  Additionally, we have added support for BlobSecondaryEndpoint, QueueSecondaryEndpoint, TableSecondaryEndpoint, and FileSecondaryEndpoint.  Specifying a secondary endpoint requires the specification of the corresponding primary.
 * The use of DefaultEndpointsProtocol in a connection string is now optional in the case where endpoints would be automatically generated; if missing, a value of https will be inferred.  When the parsed account settings in such a case are used to generate a connection string, the value of DefaultEndpointsProtocol will be explicitly included.

2017.08.30 Version 1.2.0
 * Fixed a bug when using a SAS token where the token was being omitted from calls to delete a directory in the file service.

 * Added support for server side encryption for File Service.
 * Fixed a bug that prevented setting content MD5 to true when creating a new file.
 * Fixed a bug where access conditions, options, and operation context were not being passed when calling openWriteExisting() on a page blob or a file.
 * Fixed a bug where an exception was being thrown on a range get of a blob or file when the options disableContentMD5Validation is set to false and useTransactionalContentMD5 is set to true and there is no overall MD5.
 * Fixed a bug where retries were happening immediately if a sock exception was thrown.

 * Fixed a bug in abort copy where the lease access condition was not sent to the service.
 * Fixed an issue in startCopyFromBlob where if the URI of the source blob contained certain non-ASCII characters they would not be encoded appropriately. This would result in Authorization failures.
 * Fixed a bug in BlobOutputStream and FileOutputStream where flush added data to a request pool rather than immediately committing it to the Azure service.
