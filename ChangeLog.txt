2015.05.26 Version 0.5.1
 * Fixed a bug where maximum execution time was ignored for file, queue, and table services.
 * Changed the socket timeout to be set to the service side timeout plus 5 minutes when maximum execution time is not set.
 * Changed the socket timeout to default to 5 minutes rather than infinite when neither service side timeout or maximum execution time are set.
 * Fixed a bug where MD5 was calculated for commitBlockList even though UseTransactionalMD5 was set to false.
 * Fixed a bug where selecting fields that did not exist returned an error rather than an EntityProperty with a null value.
 * Fixed a bug where table entities with a single quote in their partition or row key could be inserted but not operated on in any other way.

2015.04.02 Version 0.5.0
 * Fixed a bug for all listing API's where next() would sometimes throw an exception if hasNext() had not been called even if there were more elements to iterate on.
 * Added sequence number to the blob properties. This is populated for page blobs.
 * Creating a page blob sets its length property.
 * Added support for page blob sequence numbers and sequence number access conditions. 
 * Fixed a bug in abort copy where the lease access condition was not sent to the service.
 * Fixed an issue in startCopyFromBlob where if the URI of the source blob contained certain non-ASCII characters they would not be encoded appropriately. This would result in Authorization failures.
 * Fixed a bug in BlobOutputStream and FileOutputStream where flush added data to a request pool rather than immediately committing it to the Azure service.
 * Refactored to remove the blob, queue, and file package dependency on table in the error handling code.
 * Added additional client-side logging for REST requests, responses, and errors.

2015.01 Version 0.4.1
 * Fixed a bug for Android 5.0 only that caused auth failures on deletes.

2014.12 Version 0.4.0
 * Deprecated getSubDirectoryReference() for blob directories and file directories. Use getDirectoryReference() instead. 
 * Fixed a bug where maxResults was not verified to be positive for list operations.
 * Deprecated AuthenticationScheme and its getter and setter. In the future only SharedKey will be used.
 * Added support for EndpointSuffix which was previously not accepted in Account Strings.
 * Fixed a bug where high precision Date values stored on Table Entites were forced to fit into milliseconds resulting in inaccuracies. Precision is limited to 1 millisecond by the Android Date class. If greater precision is required, the String should be used directly.
 * Added TableRequestOptions.dateBackwardCompatibility, which supports reading Date values on Table Entities written using versions of this library prior to 0.4.0. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523753 for more details.

2014.10 Version 0.3.1
 * Fixed a bug where a NullPointerException was thrown instead of a NetworkOnMainThreadException if code was executed on the main thread.

2014.08 Version 0.3.0
 * Added the NameValidator class which contains helpers that check to see if resource names are valid.
 * Fixed a bug where the RequestUrl of a LogRecord was not correctly HTML4 decoded.
 * Made FileRange class and ListFilesAndDirectories method in the CloudFileDirectory class public. 

2014.07 Version 0.2.0
 * Added File Service support. The File Service and the associated SDK APIs are in preview. 
 * Added CloudAnalyticsClient and related methods to simplify Storage Analytics logging and metrics use case scenarios.
 * Fixed a bug where an empty file would be left over during the downloadToFile error case.
 * Updated StorageErrorCodeStrings class. 
 * Requests made using SAS credentials have the api-version query parameter appended to the URI.
 * Fixed a null pointer exception that resulted when the first request was made with a blob created using the uri-only constructor (no sas creds appended).
