This file includes:
1. Any differences between the Java and Android libraries
2. Any notes specific to the Android library

* Accept-Encoding must be specified in Android HttpURLConnection requests or it will default to 'gzip'
* AtomPub format is not supported by Tables
* Date formats with a lower case 'z' (ex RFC1123) do not produce expected timezone string (GMT+00:00 rather than GMT). RFC1123 is only used internally with GMT times, so use 'GMT' rather than 'z'
* Different userAgent/version, ex: Azure-Storage/0.1.0 (AndroidVersion 4.3; google Nexus7)
* Android serializer is used instead of stax serializer
* Deprections from 0.7.0 and earlier are removed
* JUnit3 is used instead of JUnit4
